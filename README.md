## Soccer Star Stats

glitch link: https://a3-gccromwell.glitch.me/

The goal of the application is to provide a place for soccer teams or soccer families to keep track of their own statistics and be able to compare them with their teammates, friends, and favorite star players. Each user can edit their stats once logged in, see the rest of the player's stats, or sign up.

I faced challenges starting the project. For some reason I had difficulty running code from in-class lectures so starting to include Passport and LowDB was difficult. I played around with using MongoDB but was unable to get it to work. Once I was able to figure out Passport and LowDB, the rest of the application came easier. I ended up using LowDB and the local strategy of Passport because it ended up being easier to implement. I used Bootstrap because it is one of the most popular and provided some great templates for sign-in screens. I had difficulty seeing it work as well with my other pages, so I have individual css pages for my sign-up page, home page, and edit page.

Express Middleware:
body-parser: Parses HTTP request bodies for json
cookie-parser: Parses cookie header and populate request cookies
morgan: formats HTTP request logs
response-time: records the HTTP response time
passport: local strategy authentication
session: establishes server-based sessions

## Technical Achievements
- **Added alerts for incorrect login credentials and for when you delete an account so the user understands what is going on.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Tested my website with the Wave web accessibility evaluation tool and added form labels and a fieldset/legend to significantly reduce the number of errors and make my website more accessible.
